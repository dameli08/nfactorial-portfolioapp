                <p class="description">I'm currently a Mathematics major at Nazarbayev University, but my interests span beyond numbers. 
                    I'm passionate about data science and web development. 
                    Outside of academics, I'm involved in projects with Teach for Qazaqstan to address education inequality. 
                    Recently, I've been diving into frontend web development through the NFactorial course, 
                    and I'm loving every moment of it.</p>
